# DS4 V100 Appliance Status

Last updated: 2026-05-20

## Topline

Current best 8-slot throughput remains the Sprint 107 DS4 grouped F8 fast path.
Sprint 108 tested TurboMind small-route build fusion and kept it opt-in because
the primary 8-slot/256K A/B was neutral to slightly slower. Sprint 109 tested
F8 row4 CTAs and rejected them as a default because both measured tiers
regressed.

| Mode | Context | Slots | Generated tok/s | Continuation tok/s | Correctness |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Production appliance, best observed | 262,144 | 8 | `31.811137` | `29.822941` | 8/8 token match |
| Current default A/B repeat | 262,144 | 8 | `31.794180` | `29.807044` | 8/8 token match |
| Current default | 1,048,576 | 4 | `20.081695` | `18.826589` | 4/4 token match |
| Small-route opt-in | 1,048,576 | 4 | `20.249531` | `18.983935` | 4/4 token match |

The last pre-Sprint107 committed baseline was Sprint 104 at `31.451185`
generated tok/s for 8-slot/256K and `20.026385` for 4-slot/1M.

## Recent Experiments

| Sprint | Experiment | Result | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 103 | Exact-bit E4M3 F8 decode replacing `ldexpf()` | Improved 8-slot/256K to `30.862791` generated tok/s and 4-slot/1M to `19.733742` | Shipped |
| 104 | Warp-shuffle reductions for hot F8 arena kernels | Improved 8-slot/256K repeat to `31.451185`; 4-slot/1M to `20.026385` | Shipped; current baseline |
| 105 | Extend warp reductions to BF16/F32 matmuls | Correct, but repeat result was inside Sprint 104 band | Rejected and reverted |
| 106 | Warm served `nvprof` profile of Sprint 104 | F8 rows2/grouped rows2 were ~51% GPU time; TurboMind SM70 MXFP4 was ~25%; GPU memcpy traffic was small | Use profile to choose next kernel target |
| 107 | DS4-specific grouped F8 rows2 attention-output-A kernel | Correct and faster for 8-slot/256K; neutral for 4-slot/1M | Shipped |
| 108 | TurboMind small-route count/prefix/scatter fusion | Correct; 8-slot repeat was `31.759013` opt-in vs `31.794180` rollback, while 4-slot/1M was `20.249531` opt-in vs `20.081695` rollback | Kept opt-in |
| 109 | F8 four-output-row CTA probe | Correct; regressed 8-slot/256K to `30.998275` vs `31.380225` control and 4-slot/1M to `19.898462` vs `20.041787` control | Rejected as default; opt-in only |

## Sprint 106 Profile Takeaway

The profile does not point at disk or host RAM as the decode bottleneck.
`cudaMemcpy` API accounting is noisy, but GPU memcpy time was tiny. The main
device buckets were:

- F8 rows2 arena matmul: `38.97%`
- F8 grouped rows2 arena matmul: `12.39%`
- TurboMind SM70 MXFP4 grouped GEMM: `25.42%`

That makes the practical next targets F8 execution shape and TurboMind routed
expert scheduling.

## Current Shipped Change

Sprint 107 adds a guarded DS4-specialized CUDA kernel for the fixed grouped
attention-output-A shape:

- groups: `8`
- rows per group: `1024`
- columns per group: `4096`
- fallback: existing generic grouped rows2 kernel
- rollback knob: `DS4_V100_CUDA_F8_GROUPED_DS4_FAST=0`

Validation already completed on the cluster:

- `cuda_source_dtypes_smoke`: passed
- `cuda_v100_projection_attention_smoke`: passed
- `cuda_v100_stage_scheduler_smoke --stage 0 --slots 4`: passed
- `cuda_v100_full_scheduler_smoke --slots 8`: passed
- `cuda_v100_selected_token_smoke --expected-token-hex 3136`: passed

Throughput completed:

- 8-slot/256K fast: `31.811137` generated tok/s, `8/8`
- 8-slot/256K fast repeat: `31.630774` generated tok/s, `8/8`
- 8-slot/256K rollback: `31.098630` generated tok/s, `8/8`
- 4-slot/1M fast: `20.095510` generated tok/s, `4/4`
- 4-slot/1M rollback: `20.105807` generated tok/s, `4/4`

Remaining optional validation:

- Focused profile to confirm whether grouped F8 kernel time moved.

## Current Opt-In Probe

Sprint 108 adds a guarded small-route TurboMind route builder:

- combines route count, prefix, and scatter into one one-block kernel for the
  production small-route shape;
- is controlled by `DS4_V100_TURBOMIND_SMALL_ROUTE_BUILD`;
- remains disabled by default because it did not improve the 8-slot/256K
  practical target.

Validation completed on the cluster:

- `cuda_v100_turbomind_adapter_smoke`: passed
- `cuda_v100_stage_scheduler_smoke --stage 0 --slots 4`: passed
- `cuda_v100_full_scheduler_smoke --slots 8`: passed
- selected-token smoke with small-route on: passed, token id `926`, hex `3136`
- selected-token smoke with small-route off: passed, token id `926`, hex `3136`
- rebuilt default check: `turbomind_small_route_build=0`, selected-token passed

Sprint 109 adds a guarded F8 row4 CTA probe:

- computes four large F8 output rows per CTA for the ungrouped and DS4 grouped
  attention-output paths;
- is controlled by `DS4_V100_CUDA_F8_ROW4`;
- remains disabled by default because it reduced throughput in both measured
  serving tiers.

Validation completed on the cluster:

- `cuda_source_dtypes_smoke`: passed
- `cuda_v100_projection_attention_smoke`: passed
- `cuda_v100_full_scheduler_smoke --slots 8`: passed
- selected-token smoke with row4 on: passed, token id `926`, hex `3136`

## Next Target

The next larger target should skip row-count consolidation and small
route-metadata plumbing, then attack a boundary that removes real traffic or
raises tensor-core occupancy:

- fused TurboMind gate+up packing/GEMM;
- persistent grouped expert scheduling;
- software-pipelined F8 dequant+dot work that improves instruction throughput
  without reducing occupancy.

The concise current status is also tracked in
`docs/sprints/EXPERIMENT-STATUS.md`.
